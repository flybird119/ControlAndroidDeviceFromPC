ControlAndroidDeviceFromPC
==========================

First, I have to apologize for my poor English, if there are any Grammer faults or others, please let me know.

Just as the project name says, this project is aimmed at creating a tool for manipulating android devices from pc.

This project is based on android's DDMS code. I just modify some of the code to implement the function of operating the screen of android device. The DDMS lib is a useful tool which provides function such android debug bridge connection and monkey function. So I can capture the screenshot continuously by adb and send touch events and key events to android devices(phones/pads) when the mouse is clicked or slided on the computer side.
